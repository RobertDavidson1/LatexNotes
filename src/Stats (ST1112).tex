\section{Inferential Statistics}
The ultimate goal in statistical inference is to estimate population paramaters (like the mean $\mu$) based on sample statistics (like the sample mean $\bar{X}$).
\subsection{Probability vs Statistics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Probability} deals with known underlying processes: one starts with a model (like proportion of red vs. green jelly beans in a jar) and computes probability of specific outcomes 
    \item \textbf{Statistics} works in reverse: one observes outcomes (sample data) and attempts to infer the underlying process or population paramaters (e.g. proportion of red jellybeans)
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Definitions and Concepts}
\begin{definitionbox}{Population}{}
    A \textbf{population} is the complete set of items (or individuals) of interest.
\end{definitionbox}
\begin{definitionbox}{Sample}{}
    A \textbf{sample} is a subset of that populaton, intended to represent the population\\
    
    For example the sample mean $\bar{X}$ is an estimate of the population mean $\mu$.
\end{definitionbox}
\begin{conceptbox}{Sampling Variation}{}
    When we take multiple samples from the same population, each sample's mean $\bar{X}$ will be different. This is variability is called \textbf{sampling variation}. \\

    Larger sample sizes tend to reduce this variation, that is as $n$ gros, the sample mean $\bar{X}$ becomes a better estimate of the population mean $\mu$.
\end{conceptbox}
\begin{conceptbox}{Sampling Distributions}{}
    The sample mean itself is a \textbf{random variable} becuase different samples yield different mean values.\\

    The distribution of all possible sample means (of a given sample size $n$) is called the \textbf{sampling distribution} of the sample mean ($\bar{X}$).
\end{conceptbox}

\begin{definitionbox}{Expected Value of the Sample Mean}{}
    $$E(\bar{X}) = \mu$$
    This means if you averaged all possible sample means, you would get the population mean $\mu$.
\end{definitionbox}
\begin{definitionbox}{Standard Error of the Mean}{}
    $$SD(\bar{X}) = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$
    where $\sigma$ is the population standard deviation and $n$ is the sample size.\\
    
    This value is valled the \textbf{standard error} of the mean and measures how much the sample mean $\bar{X}$ fluctuates around the population mean $\mu$.
\end{definitionbox}
