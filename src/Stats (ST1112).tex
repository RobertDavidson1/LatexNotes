\section{Inferential Statistics}
The ultimate goal in statistical inference is to estimate population paramaters (like the mean $\mu$) based on sample statistics (like the sample mean $\bar{X}$).
\subsection{Part 1}
\subsubsection{Probability vs Statistics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Probability} deals with known underlying processes: one starts with a model (like proportion of red vs. green jelly beans in a jar) and computes probability of specific outcomes 
    \item \textbf{Statistics} works in reverse: one observes outcomes (sample data) and attempts to infer the underlying process or population paramaters (e.g. proportion of red jellybeans)
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Definitions and Concepts}

\begin{definitionbox}{Population}{}
    A \textbf{population} is the complete set of items (or individuals) of interest.
\end{definitionbox}

\begin{definitionbox}{Sample}{}
    A \textbf{sample} is a subset of that populaton, intended to represent the population\\
    
    For example the sample mean $\bar{X}$ is an estimate of the population mean $\mu$.
\end{definitionbox}

\begin{definitionbox}{Population Mean ($\mu$)}{}
    $\mu$ represents the central tendence of a population distribution.
    $$\mu = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i$$
    where $N$ is the population size and $x_i$ are the individual values in the population.\\

    $\mu$ is sometimes called the expected value or average.
\end{definitionbox}

\begin{definitionbox}{Population standard deviation ($\sigma$)}{}
    $\sigma$ measures the dispersion or spread of values around the mean in a population.
    $$\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2}$$
    where $N$ is the population size and $x_i$ are the individual values in the population.\\
\end{definitionbox}

\begin{conceptbox}{Sampling Variation}{}
    When we take multiple samples from the same population, each sample's mean $\bar{X}$ will be different. This is variability is called \textbf{sampling variation}. \\

    Larger sample sizes tend to reduce this variation, that is as $n$ gros, the sample mean $\bar{X}$ becomes a better estimate of the population mean $\mu$.
\end{conceptbox}
\begin{conceptbox}{Sampling Distributions}{}
    The sample mean itself is a \textbf{random variable} becuase different samples yield different mean values.\\

    The distribution of all possible sample means (of a given sample size $n$) is called the \textbf{sampling distribution} of the sample mean ($\bar{X}$).
\end{conceptbox}

\begin{definitionbox}{Expected Value of the Sample Mean}{}
    $$E(\bar{X}) = \mu$$
    This means if you averaged all possible sample means, you would get the population mean $\mu$.
\end{definitionbox}
\begin{definitionbox}{Standard Error of the Mean}{}
    $$SD(\bar{X}) = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$
    where $\sigma$ is the population standard deviation and $n$ is the sample size.\\

    This value is valled the \textbf{standard error} of the mean and measures how much the sample mean $\bar{X}$ fluctuates around the population mean $\mu$.
\end{definitionbox}

\begin{definitionbox}{Central Limit Theorem}{}
    $$\bar{X} \sim N\left(\mu, \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right)$$
    where $\bar{X}$ is the sample mean, $\mu$ is the population mean, and $\sigma$ is the population standard deviation.\\

    The \textbf{Central Limit Theorem} states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean $\bar{X}$ (the distribution of all sample means)  approaches a normal distribution as the sample size $n$ increases, \textbf{regardless of the shape of the population distribution.}\\

    This means that for large enough sample sizes, we can use the normal distribution to make inferences about the population mean $\mu$. \\

    \textbf{Practically}, many apply the rule of thumb $n \geq 30$ to treate $\bar{X}$ as normally distributed.
\end{definitionbox}


\begin{definitionbox}{Unbiased Estimators}{}
    We say a statistic $T$ is an \textbf{unbiased estimator} of a population parameter $\theta$,  if $E(T) = \theta$.\\

    For example, the sample mean $\bar{X}$ is an unbiased estimator of the population mean $\mu$ because $E(\bar{X}) = \mu$.\\

    The sample standard deviation $s$ (using Bessel's correction, dividing by multiplying by $\frac{1}{n-1}$ rather than $\frac{1}{N}$) is an unbiased estimator of the population standard deviation $\sigma$.
\end{definitionbox}

\subsubsection{Example}
\begin{examplebox}{Weekly rent}{}
    If a population mean rent is $\mu = 225$, with $\sigma = 25$ for a population sample size $n = 30$, the sample distribution of the sample mean is approximately:
    $$\bar{X} \sim N\left(225, \frac{25^2}{30}\right)$$
    This lets us compute probabilities for specific sample mean ranges using the normal distribution (e.g. $P(\bar{X} < 220)$).
\end{examplebox}
\subsection{Part 2 - Confidence Intervals}
\subsubsection{Recap}
A \textbf{sample statistic} (e.g. the sample mean $\bar{X}$) varies from one sample to another. Understanding this variation (and quantifying it via the standard error) is crucial for knowing how precise (or imprecise) an estimate really is.
